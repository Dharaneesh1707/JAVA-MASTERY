Method overloading in Java is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, provided their parameter lists (also known as the method signature) are different. It is a form of compile-time polymorphism (static binding) where the compiler determines which method to call based on the arguments passed during the method invocation. 
Rules for Method Overloading
To successfully overload a method, the parameter list must differ in at least one of the following ways: 
Number of parameters:
java
public void display(int a) { ... }
public void display(int a, int b) { ... }
Data type of parameters:
java
public void print(int value) { ... }
public void print(String value) { ... }
Order of parameters:
java
public void processTransaction(String description, double amount) { ... }
public void processTransaction(double amount, String description) { ... }
 
Note: The return type and access modifiers can be different for overloaded methods, but they alone are not sufficient to distinguish overloaded methods. The parameter list must change. 
Example of Method Overloading
In this example, the add method is overloaded to handle different scenarios of addition: 
java
public class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers (different number of parameters)
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two doubles (different data types)
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println("Sum of two integers: " + calc.add(10, 20));
        System.out.println("Sum of three integers: " + calc.add(10, 20, 30));
        System.out.println("Sum of two doubles: " + calc.add(10.5, 20.5));
    }
}
Output:
Sum of two integers: 30
Sum of three integers: 60
Sum of two doubles: 31.0
The Java compiler determines which add method to call based on the arguments provided at compile time. 
Benefits
Improved Readability: It allows you to use the same method name for related tasks, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
Flexibility: It provides flexibility in how a method is called, accommodating different types or numbers of input.
Code Reusability: It reduces the need for multiple method names for the same core operation.
