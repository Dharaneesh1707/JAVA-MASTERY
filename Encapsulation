Encapsulation in Java is a core object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that involves bundling data (variables) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. It is also known as data hiding because it restricts direct access to an object's internal state. 
How to Achieve Encapsulation in Java
Encapsulation is primarily implemented using access modifiers, specifically by pairing private variables with public methods. 
Declare variables as private: This prevents direct access or modification of the data from any class outside its own.
Provide public getter and setter methods: These methods (accessors and mutators) are the only way to interact with the private variables. The getter method retrieves the variable's value, and the setter method sets it. 
Example of Encapsulation
Consider a Person class where you want to protect the name and age variables:
java
public class Person {
    // Private variables (data hiding)
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Public getter method for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter method for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Public getter method for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Public setter method for age with validation
    public void setAge(int age) {
        // You can add validation logic here to ensure data integrity
        if (age > 0 && age < 120) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age value.");
        }
    }
}
In a separate class, you would interact with the Person object using the public methods: 
java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person myObj = new Person();
        myObj.setName("John Doe"); // Set the value using a public method
        myObj.setAge(30);          // Set a valid age

        System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.getName()); // Get the value
        System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.getAge());   // Get the value

        myObj.setAge(-5); // Attempt to set an invalid age (will trigger validation logic)
    }
}
Benefits of Encapsulation
Data Security/Hiding: Prevents unauthorized parties from directly accessing and modifying sensitive data.
Control over data: You can implement validation logic within setter methods to ensure that variables are not set to inappropriate or invalid values (e.g., a negative age).
Flexibility and Maintainability: The internal implementation of a class can be changed (e.g., adding more variables or modifying validation logic) without affecting the external code that uses the public getter and setter methods.
Modularity and Reusability: Encapsulated classes are self-contained units with clearly defined interfaces, making them easy to test (unit testing) and reuse in different parts of a program or other applications.
Read-only/Write-only classes: By providing only a getter method, you can make a class's attribute read-only; by providing only a setter, you can make it write-only.
