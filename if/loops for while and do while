Java provides three primary loop types: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop. They are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition, with the key differences being when the condition is checked and when to use each type. 
Summary of Java Loops
Feature 	for loop	while loop	do-while loop
Condition Check	Before loop body	Before loop body	After loop body
Minimum Executions	0 times	0 times	1 time (guaranteed)
Best Used When	Number of iterations is known	Number of iterations is unknown	Loop must run at least once
Type of Loop	Entry-controlled	Entry-controlled	Exit-controlled
Semicolon after condition	No	No	Yes
for loop
The for loop is ideal when you know the exact number of times you want to iterate. It provides a concise way to handle the initialization, condition, and update of a loop counter in a single line. 
Syntax:
java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code block to be executed
}
Example:
java
public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints numbers from 1 to 5
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
while loop
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition remains true. The condition is checked before each iteration, so the loop body may never execute. 
Syntax:
java
while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
