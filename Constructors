A constructor in Java is a special block of code used to initialize objects when they are created. It is automatically called when an instance of a class is created using the new keyword, ensuring the object starts in a valid state. 
Key Characteristics
Same Name as Class: A constructor must have the exact same name as the class it belongs to.
No Return Type: It does not have a return type, not even void. If a return type is declared, it is treated as a normal method.
Automatic Invocation: Constructors are invoked implicitly by the Java runtime at object creation time.
Initialization Focus: Their primary purpose is to set initial values for the object's instance variables (fields).
Cannot be Inherited or Overridden: Constructors are not inherited by subclasses, though subclass constructors must call a superclass constructor.
Modifiers: They can use access modifiers (public, private, protected, default) but cannot be abstract, final, static, or synchronized. 
Types of Constructors
There are two primary types of constructors that developers define: 
Default Constructor (No-Arg): A constructor that takes no arguments. If you do not define any constructor in your class, the Java compiler automatically provides a default, no-argument constructor. This default constructor initializes instance variables to their default values (e.g., 0 for int, null for objects, false for boolean). 
java
public class Bike {
    int speed;
    // Compiler provides a default constructor if none is defined.
    // Equivalent to:
    // public Bike() {
    //     speed = 0;
    // }
}
Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that accepts one or more parameters. This allows you to initialize the object with specific, custom values at the time of creation. 
java
public class Car {
    String modelName;
    int modelYear;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Car(int year, String name) {
        modelYear = year;
        modelName = name;
    }
}
// Usage: Car myCar = new Car(1969, "Mustang");
Constructor Overloading
A class can have multiple constructors with the same name, as long as each has a unique parameter list (different number of parameters, different types, or different order of types). This is known as constructor overloading and provides flexibility in how an object can be initialized. 
java
public class Student {
    int id;
    String name;

    // Constructor with no parameters (no-arg constructor)
    public Student() {
        id = 0;
        name = "Unknown";
    }

    // Constructor with two parameters
    public Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
Copying Objects
While Java doesn't have a dedicated "copy constructor" keyword like C++, you can achieve the same result by defining a constructor that takes an object of the same class as an argument and copies its fields. 
java
class Student {
    String name;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Copy Constructor (mimic)
    Student(Student other) {
        this.name = other.name;
    }
}
