The static keyword in Java is a non-access modifier used to declare members that belong to the class itself, rather than to any specific instance (object) of the class. This means a single copy of a static member is shared across all objects of that class, and it can be accessed without creating an object. 
The static keyword can be applied to:
Variables (Class Variables): A single copy is shared by all instances and is initialized once when the class loads. They are useful for common properties like a company name or constants.
Methods (Class Methods): These can be called directly using the class name and can only access other static members. The main method is static to allow the JVM to start execution without an object. They are suitable for utility functions.
Blocks (Static Initialization Blocks): Used to initialize static variables, these blocks execute once when the class is loaded. They are useful for complex static initialization or loading resources.
Nested Classes (Static Nested Classes): Only nested classes can be declared static. They do not need an outer class instance and can only access the outer class's static members. They are used for logical grouping without needing access to outer instance members. 
Key Characteristics and Restrictions
Memory Efficiency: Static members use less memory as they are allocated once per class.
Access: Accessed using ClassName.memberName.
Context Restrictions: Cannot use this or super keywords.
Inheritance: Static methods cannot be overridden.
