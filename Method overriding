Method overriding in Java is a feature that allows a subclass (child class) to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class). This mechanism is crucial for achieving runtime polymorphism. 
Overriding occurs when a subclass method has the same signature and a compatible return type as a superclass method. The subclass implementation replaces the inherited behavior. Using the @Override annotation is recommended. A basic example involves an Animal class with a makeSound method overridden in a Dog subclass to print "Dog barks" instead of "Animal makes a sound". This illustrates dynamic method dispatch, where the method executed depends on the object type at runtime. Key rules include requiring inheritance, matching signatures, compatible return types, and not restricting access more than the superclass. final, static, and private methods, as well as constructors, cannot be overridden. The super keyword can call the superclass method from the overriding method.
