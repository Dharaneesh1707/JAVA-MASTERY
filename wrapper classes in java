In Java, wrapper classes are classes that encapsulate primitive data types (like int, char, boolean) into objects. They are essential for bridging the gap between Java's primitive types and its object-oriented features, such as collections and generics. 
The Eight Wrapper Classes
Each of the eight primitive data types in Java has a corresponding wrapper class in the java.lang package. 
Primitive Type 	Wrapper Class
boolean	Boolean
byte	Byte
char	Character
short	Short
int	Integer
long	Long
float	Float
double	Double
Key Purposes and Advantages
Use in Collections: Java's collection framework (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap) can only store objects, not primitives. Wrapper classes allow you to store primitive values in these collections (e.g., ArrayList<Integer>).
Null Values: Unlike primitives (which have a default value like 0 or false), wrapper class objects can hold a null value, which is useful for representing the absence of a value, often necessary when working with databases.
Utility Methods: Wrapper classes provide a variety of useful static methods for operations like type conversion, parsing strings into primitive types (e.g., Integer.parseInt("123")), and comparing values.
Generics Support: Generics in Java require objects as type parameters, so wrapper classes enable the use of primitives in generic programming.
Serialization and Synchronization: Operations like serialization (converting objects into streams) and synchronization in multithreading require objects, making wrapper classes necessary.
Immutability and Thread Safety: All wrapper class objects are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed once created. This characteristic makes them inherently thread-safe. 
Autoboxing and Unboxing
Java provides automatic conversions between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes, a feature called autoboxing and unboxing. 
Autoboxing: The automatic conversion of a primitive type to a wrapper object.
java
int primitiveInt = 42;
Integer wrapperInt = primitiveInt; // Autoboxing
Unboxing: The automatic conversion of a wrapper object to its corresponding primitive type.
java
Integer wrapperInt = 100;
int primitiveInt = wrapperInt; // Unboxing
 
Example Usage
java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class WrapperExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using Integer wrapper class in an ArrayList
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Autoboxing (int to Integer)
        numbers.add(10);
        numbers.add(20);

        // Unboxing (Integer to int) during retrieval
        int firstNumber = numbers.get(0);
        
        System.out.println("First number: " + firstNumber);
        
        // Using a utility method
        String str = "300";
        int parsedInt = Integer.parseInt(str);
        System.out.println("Parsed int: " + parsedInt); 
    }
