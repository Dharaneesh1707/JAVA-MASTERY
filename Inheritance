Inheritance in Java is a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of an existing class (superclass). This mechanism promotes code reusability, improves code organization, and is crucial for achieving polymorphism. 
Key concepts include the subclass (inheriting from a superclass), superclass (providing common functionality), the extends keyword for inheritance, the super keyword to refer to superclass members, and the "IS-A" relationship that inheritance models. 
Java supports various types of inheritance, including single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance. While Java classes do not support multiple inheritance directly, it can be achieved through interfaces. Hybrid inheritance, a mix of different types, is also possible using classes and interfaces. 
Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a superclass method, often indicated by the @Override annotation. The final keyword can prevent variable value changes, method overriding, or class extension. 
Inheritance offers advantages like code reusability and supporting polymorphism. However, potential disadvantages include creating tight coupling between classes and increased complexity in deep hierarchies. Misusing inheritance for a "has-a" relationship instead of an "is-a" relationship can also lead to poor design. Additional details on inheritance in Java can be found at ccbp.in.
