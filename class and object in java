In Java, Classes and Objects are the basic building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
1. Java Class
A class is a user-defined blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the structure and behavior that its objects will have but does not occupy memory itself. 
Components: It typically contains fields (variables for state) and methods (functions for behavior).
Syntax: Use the class keyword followed by the class name. 
2. Java Object
An object is a physical instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has a state, behavior, and a unique identity. 
State: Represented by attributes (variables).
Behavior: Represented by methods.
Identity: A unique name that allows objects to interact. 
Key Differences
Feature 	Class	Object
Nature	Logical template/blueprint.	Physical instance/entity.
Memory	No memory is allocated upon definition.	Memory is allocated in the Heap upon creation.
Creation	Declared once using the class keyword.	Created many times using the new keyword.
Practical Example
If "Car" is the class (defining that all cars have a color and can drive), then a "Red Tesla" or a "Blue Ford" are the objects (specific instances with their own data). 
java
// Defining the Class (Blueprint)
class Car {
    String color; // Field (State)
    void drive() { // Method (Behavior)
        System.out.println("The car is driving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an Object (Instance)
        Car myCar = new Car(); 
        myCar.color = "Red"; // Setting state
        myCar.drive(); // Calling behavior
    }
}
